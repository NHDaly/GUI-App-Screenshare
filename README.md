GUI-App-Screenshare
===================

A very low-feature vnc application written using my GUI library for interactive screen-sharing between Mac and Windows.


Currently only allows for sharing Mac applications to Windows, because I haven't wanted to figure out the WinAPI stuff to do it the other way.
